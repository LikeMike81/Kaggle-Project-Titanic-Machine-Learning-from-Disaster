# Kaggle-Project-Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
In this repository I try to tackle the Kaggle competition: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster:

This is my first try. I am playing around with XGBoost. First results don't look too bad, 89% right predictions on the train-set. I will continue with feature engineering and playing around with the grid search parameters.

I have implemented some more machine learning algorithms now. A neural network with Keras gave me the best result so far. Still playing around with grid search.
